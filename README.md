A line follower robot is a self-operating machine that follows a predefined path using sensors. It is often built with:

Chassis: The base structure holding all components together.

Motors & Wheels: For movement and steering.

IR Sensors: To detect the contrast between the line and the background.

Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi): To process sensor data and control motor actions.

Power Source: Usually a battery pack to power the components.

When powered on, the robot continuously scans the ground beneath it. The IR sensors detect whether the robot is on or off the line. Based on this input, the microcontroller adjusts the motorsâ€™ speed or direction to correct the robot's path and keep it aligned with the line.

Applications:
Industrial automation (material transport)

Educational robotics projects

Prototype for autonomous vehicles

Maze-solving or pathfinding challenges
